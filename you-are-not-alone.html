    <h1>You Are Not Alone</h1>
    <p>Hey, I know things have been really heavy lately. People talk, pressures build up, and sometimes it feels like the weight of it all is too much. I just want you to know that you’re not alone. You are loved, more than you probably realize. I care about you deeply, and I see how hard you’re trying, even on the days when it feels like everything is falling apart.</p>

    <p>I know it’s not easy to keep going when the world feels like it’s pushing back against you. But you are stronger than you think. I believe in you, fully and genuinely. And no matter what anyone says or how overwhelming things get, I’m here. I’ve got you. You don’t have to have all the answers or pretend everything is okay. You’re allowed to struggle. You’re allowed to feel tired. Just don’t give up.</p>

    <p>You’re important. To me. To the people who truly know you. And even if it’s hard to see right now, there is still so much ahead of you that’s worth staying for. Please keep going. I’m with you, always.</p>
